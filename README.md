# Clustering commodity markets in space and time: Clarifying returns, volatility, and trading regimes through unsupervised machine learning
Unsupervised machine learning can interpret logarithmic returns and conditional volatility in commodity
markets. This article applies machine learning in order to visualize and interpret log returns and conditional
volatility in commodities trading. We emphasize two classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and
manifold learning for the reduction of dimensionality. We source daily prices from September 18, 2000 through
July 31, 2020, for precious metals, base metals), energy commodities and agricultural commodities. Our results
highlight that at the very least, returns-based clusters conform more closely to traditional boundaries between
precious metals, base metals, fuels, temperate-climate agricultural commodities, and tropical agricultural commodities.
On the other hand, volatility-based clustering succeeds in identifying periods of extreme market
distress, such as the global financial crisis of 2008â€“09 and the Covid-19 pandemic
